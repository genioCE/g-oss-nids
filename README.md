# g-oss-nids â€” Zeek + Suricata (network IDS)

**What:** Containerized Zeek & Suricata sensors to parse and alert on traffic (mirror port or PCAP).

**Why:** Lightweight NIDS for pilot networks; export logs to Loki/OpenSearch.

**Note:** Requires a traffic feed (SPAN/mirror/pcap). Not a replacement for enterprise IDS out of the gate.
